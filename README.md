# HummingPayment-Terminal
Code for Point-of-Sale Terminals written in Python.
It is meant to be modular and easy to be adapted for your hardware setup.

## To-Do List
### Short term
* Use gevent coroutines instead of threads
* "*Control*" class for card/tag based or button based control
* split "*interface.py*" into *UI* and *Output*

### Long term
* Terminal could be bind with an article instead of a amount
* HTTP + JSON for UI (and maybe other stuff)
* Connect to Server (that we will work on) instead poll MySQL for data directly
* Provide code for more hardware configurations

### Not Prioritized
* Proper PIP Packaging [Not before beta]
